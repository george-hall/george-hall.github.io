I am a computer scientist developing algorithms for the analysis of single-cell and spatial RNAseq data. After completing [my PhD](projects/doctoral) in computer science, in which I laid a theoretical foundation for automated algorithm configuration, for my postdoctoral research I decided to take a position where algorithm design can be motivated by important real-world applications. I joined the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child health, which allows me to develop algorithms to meet the needs of the world-renowned children's hospital. A summary of my postdoctoral research can be found [here](projects/postdoctoral).
