Before moving to UCL, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University
of Sheffield. I conducted theoretical analyses of algorithm configurators,
tools that optimise the settings of other algorithms. These tools are of
particular interest today since they can be used to optimise the
hyperparameters of machine learning models.

My research was the first to try to establish a rigorous grounding for these
tools and address key questions such as whether a given configurator will ever
be able to identify optimal parameter settings for an algrorithm, and, if so,
how long will it require to do so. This work led us to the insight that the
traditional way of measuring the performance of a configuration of an
optimisation algorithm (by measuring the time it takes to reach the optimum of
the problem) is problematic, and we proved that a faster approach is to look at
the best solution achieved by the configuration within a given time budget.

We published these findings in two conference papers and extended the first in
a paper published in Artificial Intelligence:

  performance metric on efficient algorithm configuration._ Artificial
  Intelligence (2022).
