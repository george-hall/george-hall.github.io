Since November 2020, I have been working as a Research Fellow in the Genetics
and Genomic Medicine Department at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of
Child Health. As a member of the Institute's Biomedical Resarch Centre, I have
been using single-cell transcriptomics and machine learning to carry out
translational research across a number of projects.

I am co-first author on a paper that examines the effects of applying a drug
(ROCKi) to accelerate the growth of skin sheets grown in the lab. This is
essential for treating genetic skin disorders with gene therapy in the clinic.
This work centred around using single-cell transcriptomics to assess whether
accelerating growth has an adverse effect on the quality of the resulting skin
sheet. [Short-Term Treatment with Rho-Associated Kinase Inhibitor Preserves
Keratinocyte Stem Cell Characteristics In
Vitro](http://doi.org/10.3390/cells12030346).

I am leading the analysis and algorithm development in a number of other
single-cell transcriptomics projects that are currently unpublished:

* Machine learning methods to detect transcriptomic regions of similarity
  between two conditions.
* Characterisation of CAR-T cells to improve our ability to use them to treat
  leukemia.
* Characterisation of different types of stem cells.
