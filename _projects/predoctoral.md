For the third year of my undergraduate degree, I worked in the High Performance
Assembly Group at the Wellcome Sanger Insitute. This established my motivation
for a career in research aimed at helping solve major problems in human health.
I contributed to a number of projects during my time there, most notably
carrying out [quality control of genome
assemblies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2018.03.013) and developing [a
method](https://github.com/george-hall-wtsi/GRIn) to quantify the difficulty of
assembling genomes by estimating the proportion of repetitive elements.
